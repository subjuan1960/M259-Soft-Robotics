Problem 1

For Problem1.m simply run the file for the simulations. 
Problem1_implicit.m gives the implicit simulation
Problem1_explicit.m gives the explicit simulation.


Problem 2
Run file Problem2.m for simulations and plots. Individual plots asked in the assignment are included in each section of the code.

Problem 3
Run file Problem3.m for simulations and plots. Change the variable ‘P’ from 2,000 to 20,000 to simulate increased loading on the beam. 
Euler’s equation is included at the very end of the code. The Max displacement plot is included.
